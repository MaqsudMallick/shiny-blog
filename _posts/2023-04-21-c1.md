'I need to know my abilities first.' (TL: *So many times, same dialogue*)

Although the basic status is poor, there may be hidden special abilities or unique abilities involved for Lowell.

Of course, the probability of that happening would be miniscule. I would probably have a better chance of getting stuck by lightning while being indoors than this.

But, I had some hopes nonetheless.

<br />

```
Name: Lowell Iris
Gender: Male
Age: 16
From: Iris Marquis Household

Attribute: Ice
Stamina: 3 
Dexterity: 2
Strength: 4
HP: 3
Mental-Power: 8
Luck: 5

Activate special abilities [!]

```

<br />

Opening my status screen, once again the desolate stats greet me.

I didn't see it before because I was out of my mind, but there was an exclamation mark on the "Activate Special Abilities" column.

'Can I really look forward to this?'

```
[Special Abilitiy Details] 
Talent: Strong Mental Power
Unique Ability: Acceleration (Insufficient stats to use)

[Magic]

Ice Element: Icicle Generation Lvl 1

```

I was looking forward to something nice, but once again there was little that caught his interest.

Other than being able to figure out why I had such high mental power compared to other stats, there was no specific gain.

I didn't expect much because most students don't master any proper special abilities or unique abilities in the first grade. Not to mention Lowell is just a freshman.

But the fact that Lowell who is from a Marquis household and should have received adequate priviledges and advanced education since childhood, and yet is the bottom of the lot is a mystery that I would never be able to solve.

Testament to just how pathetic Lowell Iris is.

Just as he was about to close the window in disappointment, a sparkling exclamation mark caught his eye.

```
[!] Unique Ability: Acceleration (insufficient stats to fully use) (TL: ðŸ˜­ðŸ™ƒ)
```

I have never heard anything by the name 'acceleration in the original game even though I know most of the abilities in the game.

'Acceleration... probably means running fast?'

Judging from its name, it is an ability that is completely unsuitable for a wizard. (TL: ðŸ™„)

The mage runs a little faster... what's the use in that? 

Of course, it could be quite useful of a utility for maintaining distance, such as moving away from your opponent.

But if it is simply to be faster, then this alone won't be enough to claim victory. It will not be a good ability.

I wanted to use this ability right away, but I decided against it so I closed the status window for now.

'It can't make up for the lack of practical skills. Even a child can figure it out. All it helps is making you run around like a harmless rat. But I guess beggars can't be choosers.'
